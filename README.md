# Machine-Lang-Lab-01

Source &amp; binaries for lab work 1 in Machine-Dependent Programming Languages course.

## Abstract

The task is to calculate the value of given expression for signed and unsigned formats: signed char, unsigned char и signed int, unsigned int. Initial values of variables are entered from keyboard. Size and type of numerator, denominator and result depend on given number.

## Directories

Source code is stored in `src` directory. Object files usedfor compiling are stored in `obj` directory. Makefile is stored in `build` directory. Executable file is stored in `bin` directory.

## Variable Prefixes

There is custom prefixes system used in project. Here is a meaning of prefixes:
* `sc = signed char`
* `ui = unsigned char`
* `si = signed int`
* `ui = unsigned int`
